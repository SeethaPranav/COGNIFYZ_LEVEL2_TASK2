# 📁 Level 2 - Task 2: Cuisine Combinations and Ratings
## Description
This task identifies which cuisine combinations (e.g., Italian & Mexican, Indian & Chinese) are most frequently offered together and whether some combinations result in better ratings.

### What Was Done:
- Analyzed the frequency of different cuisine pairings using `value_counts`.
- Grouped the dataset by `Cuisines` and calculated average ratings per combination.
- Sorted combinations to identify the highest-rated ones.

### Insights:
- Certain combinations are both common and highly rated (e.g., Japanese & Korean).
- This analysis can be useful for menu planning and market strategy.
